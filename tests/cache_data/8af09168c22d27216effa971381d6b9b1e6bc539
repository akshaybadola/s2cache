{"abstract": "Fully trained convolutional neural networks are being used nowadays in various applications. But, can we get an understanding on how they actually work? A small step in that direction is taken in this paper. The filters of the first layers seem to be fairly straightforward and mostly are known and recognizable. If one makes a network with fixed weights on the filters, how is its performance compared with a fully trained one? And how is the training time influenced? This paper, answers this question by experimenting in a verification style CNN put in three different situations: first a fixed layer network, second a set layer network and third a fully trained CNN. It is shown that although similar results can be achieved with the three networks, a fully trained one still has superior performance; however, training time is increased as the number of fixed layers are increased.", "arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "73646975", "name": "Alexandros Kyrloglou", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/73646975"}], "citationVelocity": 0, "citations": [], "corpusId": 67332478, "doi": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "isPublisherLicensed": false, "is_open_access": false, "is_publisher_licensed": false, "numCitedBy": 0, "numCiting": 5, "paperId": "8af09168c22d27216effa971381d6b9b1e6bc539", "references": [{"arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2143795572", "name": "Yi Sun"}, {"authorId": "31843833", "name": "Xiaogang Wang"}, {"authorId": "50295995", "name": "Xiaoou Tang"}], "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2505293", "intent": [], "isInfluential": false, "paperId": "ed2b19734b7001c324e711524f39225e9cbb46af", "title": "Hybrid Deep Learning for Face Verification", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ed2b19734b7001c324e711524f39225e9cbb46af", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision", "year": 2016}, {"arxivId": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1565641737", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Chollet"}], "doi": null, "intent": [], "isInfluential": false, "paperId": "77cec64cdf0581ff4e7b70aa595a4d6e39b70ce4", "title": "Keras: The Python Deep Learning library", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/77cec64cdf0581ff4e7b70aa595a4d6e39b70ce4", "venue": "", "year": 2018}], "title": "Fixed layer Convolutional Neural Network", "topics": [{"topic": "Convolutional neural network", "topicId": "29860", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/topic/29860"}], "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8af09168c22d27216effa971381d6b9b1e6bc539", "venue": "", "year": 2018}
