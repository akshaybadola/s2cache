The aim of this review was to discuss the application of RT-PCR technology for detecting and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 among armed forces to successfully halt COVID-19 transmission. Evidence Acquisition: Relevant literature was collected from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar Results: By combining both detection and quantification of pathogens, RT-PCR provides a reliable and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 via targeting the viral ORF1ab, E, and N genes. Military surveillance plays an important role in the early detection and identification of positive cases, isolating infected patients, contact tracing, and quarantine to contain the spread of the disease among personnel. This technology emerges as a suitable tool for disease surveillance in the military and early detection and control of diseases. Conclusions: The COVID-19 disease has spread into different parts of the world and may affect military training and operations. So, there is a need for active disease surveillance and preparedness plans in the military. Accordingly, RT-PCR, as a standard tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection, can be used for the surveillance and monitoring of military personnel to successfully curtail COVID-19.", "venue": "", "year": 2021,

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56\u2009\u00b0C has been recommended to inactivate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Methods We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT. Results Our work showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. Conclusion Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.", "venue": "Clinical Chemistry", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 205, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article-pdf/66/6/794/33323373/hvaa091.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Chemistry", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-04-04", "journal": {"name": "Clinical Chemistry"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Pan2020PotentialFN,\n author = {Yang Pan and L.

The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based two target genes (ORF1ab and N). Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging. Results In 95 samples tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87). 4 (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral load ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test. Then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum (17429 \u00b1 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 \u00b1 1965 copies/test, p < 0.001) and nasal swabs (651 \u00b1 501 copies/test, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46800 \u00b1 17272 vs 1252 \u00b1 1027, p < 0.001) analyzed by sputum samples.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nRetrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020.\n\n\nExposures\nDocumented NCIP.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nEpidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.\n\n\nResults\nOf 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u200936), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n\u2009=\u200947), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.", "venue": "Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 28, "citationCount": 20015, "influentialCitationCount": 1016, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/articlepdf/2761044/jama_wang_2020_oi_200019.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-02-07", "journal": {"name": "JAMA"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Wang2020ClinicalCO,\n author = {Dawei Wang and Bo Hu and Chang Hu and Fangfang Zhu and Xing Liu and Jing Zhang and Binbin Wang and Hui Xiang and Zhenshun Cheng and Y.

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. Methods We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. Results Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10\u22124-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. Conclusions The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.", "venue": "Clinical Chemistry", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount": 1134, "influentialCitationCount": 61, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article-pdf/66/4/549/33647118/hvaa029.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2020-01-31", "journal": {"name": "Clinical Chemistry"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Chu2020MolecularDO,\n author = {D.

Adults who consumed 10 or more standard drinks (with 1 standard drink containing approximately 12 g of pure alcohol) per week and who had paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation in sinus rhythm at baseline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either abstain from alcohol or continue their usual alcohol consumption. The two primary end points were freedom from recurrence of atrial fibrillation (after a 2-week \"blanking period\") and total atrial fibrillation burden (proportion of time in atrial fibrillation) during 6 months of follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 140 patients who underwent randomization (85% men; mean [\u00b1SD] age, 62\u00b19 years), 70 were assigned to the abstinence group and 70 to the control group. Patients in the abstinence group reduced their alcohol intake from 16.8\u00b17.7 to 2.1\u00b13.7 standard drinks per week (a reduction of 87.5%), and patients in the control group reduced their alcohol intake from 16.4\u00b16.9 to 13.2\u00b16.5 drinks per week (a reduction of 19.5%). After a 2-week blanking period, atrial fibrillation recurred in 37 of 70 patients (53%) in the abstinence group and in 51 of 70 patients (73%) in the control group. The abstinence group had a longer period before recurrence of atrial fibrillation than the control group (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.84; P\u2009=\u20090.005). The atrial fibrillation burden over 6 months of follow-up was significantly lower in the abstinence group than in the control group (median percentage of time in atrial fibrillation, 0.5% [interquartile range, 0.0 to 3.0] vs. 1.2% [interquartile range, 0.0 to 10.3]; P\u2009=\u20090.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbstinence from alcohol reduced arrhythmia recurrences in regular drinkers with atrial fibrillation.

Methods Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV. Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses. Control material is made available through European Virus Archive \u2013 Global (EVAg), a European Union infrastructure project.

A surface spike (S) protein guides MERS-CoV entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), followed by fusion between virus and host cell membranes. MERS-CoV S protein represents a key target for developing therapeutics to block viral entry and inhibit membrane fusion. Areas covered: This review illustrates MERS-CoV S protein\u2019s structure and function, particularly S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) as therapeutic targets, and summarizes current advancement on developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics, focusing on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral peptides. Expert opinion: No anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic is approved for human use. Several S-targeting neutralizing mAbs and peptides have demonstrated efficacy against MERS-CoV infection, providing feasibility for development. Generally, human neutralizing mAbs targeting RBD are more potent than those targeting other regions of S protein. However, emergence of escape mutant viruses and mAb\u2019s limitations make it necessary for combining neutralizing mAbs recognizing different neutralizing epitopes and engineering them with improved efficacy and reduced cost. Optimization of the peptide sequences is expected to produce next-generation anti-MERS-CoV peptides with improved potency.", "venue": "Expert opinion on therapeutic targets", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 107, "citationCount": 238, "influentialCitationCount": 11, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5457961?pdf=render", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2017-02-01", "journal": {"volume": "21", "pages": "131 - 143", "name": "Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Du2017MERSCoVSP,\n author = {L.

In a survey for MERSCoV in over 1300 Saudi Arabian camels, Sabir et al. found that dromedaries share three coronavirus species with humans. Diverse MERS lineages in camels have caused human infections, which suggests that transfer among host species occurs quite easily. Haagmans et al. made a MERS-CoV vaccine for use in camels, using poxvirus as a vehicle. The vaccine significantly reduced virus excretion, which should help reduce the potential for transmission to humans, and conferred cross-immunity to camelpox infections.

Outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) raise questions about the prevalence and evolution of the MERS coronavirus (CoV) in its animal reservoir. Our surveillance in Saudi Arabia in 2014 and 2015 showed that viruses of the MERS-CoV species and a human CoV 229E\u2013related lineage co-circulated at high prevalence, with frequent co-infections in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels. viruses of the betacoronavirus 1 species, we found that dromedary camels share three CoV species with humans. Several MERS-CoV lineages were present in camels, including a recombinant lineage that has been dominant since December 2014 and that subsequently led to the human outbreaks in 2015.

E gene encodes a small multifunctional protein that possesses ion channel (IC) activity, an important function in virus-host interaction. To test the contribution of E protein IC activity in virus pathogenesis, two recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs, each containing one single amino acid mutation that suppressed ion conductivity, were engineered. After serial infections, mutant viruses, in general, incorporated compensatory mutations within E gene that rendered active ion channels. Furthermore, IC activity conferred better fitness in competition assays, suggesting that ion conductivity represents an advantage for the virus. Interestingly, mice infected with viruses displaying E protein IC activity, either with the wild-type E protein sequence or with the revertants that restored ion transport, rapidly lost weight and died. In contrast, mice infected with mutants lacking IC activity, which did not incorporate mutations within E gene during the experiment, recovered from disease and most survived. Knocking down E protein IC activity did not significantly affect virus growth in infected mice but decreased edema accumulation, the major determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to death. Reduced edema correlated with lung epithelia integrity and proper localization of Na+/K+ ATPase, which participates in edema resolution. Levels of inflammasome-activated IL-1\u03b2 were reduced in the lung airways of the animals infected with viruses lacking E protein IC activity, indicating that E protein IC function is required for inflammasome activation. Reduction of IL-1\u03b2 was accompanied by diminished amounts of TNF and IL-6 in the absence of E protein ion conductivity. All these key cytokines promote the progression of lung damage and ARDS pathology.

Additionally, N protein participates in at least one stage of the complex mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis. We previously uncovered an unanticipated interaction between N and the largest subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). This was found through analysis of revertants of a severely defective mutant of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the N gene was replaced with that of its close relative, bovine coronavirus (BCoV). In the work reported here, we constructed BCoV chimeras and other mutants of MHV nsp3 and obtained complementary genetic evidence for its association with N protein. We found that the N-nsp3 interaction maps to the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3, which is essential for the virus. The interaction does not require the adjacent acidic domain of nsp3, which is dispensable. In addition, we demonstrated a complete correspondence between N-nsp3 genetic interactions and the ability of N protein to enhance the infectivity of transfected coronavirus genomic RNA. The latter function of N was shown to depend on both of the RNA-binding domains of N, as well as on the serine- and arginine-rich central region of N, which binds nsp3. Our results support a model in which the N-nsp3 interaction serves to tether the genome to the newly translated replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection.", "venue": "Journal of Virology", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 72, "citationCount": 128, "influentialCitationCount": 12, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3754073?pdf=render", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "History", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "History", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-12", "journal": {"volume": "87", "pages": "9159 - 9172", "name": "Journal of Virology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Hurst2013CharacterizationOA,\n author = {Kelley R.

The genomic packaging signal (PS) for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was originally identified as an element that conferred packaging capability to defective interfering RNAs. The MHV PS is an RNA structure that maps to the region of the replicase gene encoding the nonstructural protein 15 subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. To begin to understand the role and mechanism of action of the MHV PS in its native genomic locus, we constructed viral mutants in which this cis-acting element was altered, deleted, or transposed. Our results demonstrated that the PS is pivotal in the selection of viral genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. Mutants in which PS RNA secondary structure was disrupted or entirely ablated packaged large quantities of subgenomic RNAs, in addition to genomic RNA. Moreover, the PS retained its function when displaced to an ectopic site in the genome. Surprisingly, the PS was not essential for MHV viability, nor did its elimination have a severe effect on viral growth. However, the PS was found to provide a distinct selective advantage to MHV. Viruses containing the PS readily outcompeted their otherwise isogenic counterparts lacking the PS.", "venue": "Journal of Virology", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 62, "influentialCitationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3624306?pdf=render", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-28", "journal": {"volume": "87", "pages": "5182 - 5192", "name": "Journal of Virology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Kuo2013FunctionalAO,\n author = {L.

This ribonucleoprotein structure becomes packaged into virions through association with the carboxy-terminal endodomain of the membrane protein (M), which is the principal constituent of the virion envelope. Previous work with the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has shown that a major determinant of the N-M interaction maps to the carboxy-terminal domain 3 of the N protein. To explore other domain interactions of the MHV N protein, we expressed a series of segments of the MHV N protein as fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) during the course of viral infection. We found that two of these GFP-N-domain fusion proteins were selectively packaged into virions as the result of tight binding to the N protein in the viral nucleocapsid, in a manner that did not involve association with either M protein or RNA. The nature of each type of binding was further explored through genetic analysis. Our results defined two strongly interacting regions of the N protein. One is the same domain 3 that is critical for M protein recognition during assembly. The other is domain N1b, which corresponds to the N-terminal domain that has been structurally characterized in detail for two other coronaviruses, infectious bronchitis virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.", "venue": "Journal of Virology", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 62, "citationCount": 149, "influentialCitationCount": 11, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2704785?pdf=render", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-06", "journal": {"volume": "83", "pages": "7221 - 7234", "name": "Journal of Virology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Hurst2009IdentificationOI,\n author = {Kelley R.

Here we report the 3D virion structure of coronaviruses obtained by cryo-electron tomography. Our study focused primarily on the coronavirus prototype murine hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV particles have a distinctly spherical shape and a relatively homogenous size (\u224885 nm envelope diameter). The viral envelope exhibits an unusual thickness (7.8 \u00b1 0.7 nm), almost twice that of a typical biological membrane. Focal pairs revealed the existence of an extra internal layer, most likely formed by the C-terminal domains of the major envelope protein M. In the interior of the particles, coiled structures and tubular shapes are observed, consistent with a helical nucleocapsid model. Our reconstructions provide no evidence of a shelled core. Instead, the ribonucleoprotein seems to be extensively folded onto itself, assuming a compact structure that tends to closely follow the envelope at a distance of \u22484 nm. Focal contact points and thread-like densities connecting the envelope and the ribonucleoprotein are revealed in the tomograms. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirion tomograms confirm all the general features and global architecture observed for MHV.

This utilizes either dsDNA binding dyes or probe based chemistry. While dsDNA binding dyes have the advantage of low cost and flexibility, fluorescence due to primer dimers also interferes with the fluorescence of the specific product. Sometimes it is difficult, if not impossible, to standardize conditions and redesign primers in such a way that only specific fluorescence of the products of test and reference genes are acquired. Normally, the fluorescence acquisition in qPCR using dsDNA binding dyes is done during the melting phase of the PCR at a temperature between the melting points of primer dimers and the specific product. We have modified the protocol to acquire fluorescence during the hybridization phase. This significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio and enabled the use of dsDNA binding dyes for mRNA quantification in situations where it was not possible when measurement was done in the melting phase. We have demonstrated it for three mRNAs, E6, E7, and DNMT1 with beta-actin as the reference gene, and for two miRNAs.

No differences in virion stability under a wide range of pH and temperature were detected between the deletion mutant and recombinant wild-type viruses. Although both viruses showed the same morphology by electron microscopy, the process of morphogenesis seemed to be less efficient with the defective virus than with the recombinant wild-type one. The rSARS-CoV-\u0394E virus replicated to titers 100- to 1,000-fold lower than the recombinant wild-type virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters, and the lower viral load was accompanied by less inflammation in the lungs of hamsters infected with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E virus than with the recombinant wild-type virus.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an essential role in SARS-CoV genome packaging and virion assembly. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV N protein forms a dimer in solution through its C-terminal domain. In this study, the crystal structure of the dimerization domain, consisting of residues 270\u2013370, is determined to 1.75A\u030a resolution. The structure shows a dimer with extensive interactions between the two subunits, suggesting that the dimeric form of the N protein is the functional unit in vivo. Although lacking significant sequence similarity, the dimerization domain of SARS-CoV N protein has a fold similar to that of the nucleocapsid protein of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. This finding provides structural evidence of the evolutionary link between Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae, suggesting that the N proteins of both viruses have a common origin.", "venue": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 48, "citationCount": 117, "influentialCitationCount": 9, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.jbc.org/article/S0021925820557402/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2006-06-23", "journal": {"volume": "281", "pages": "17134 - 17139", "name": "The Journal of Biological Chemistry"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Yu2006CrystalSO,\n author = {I.

Although the molecular basis by which protein kinase A (PKA) regulates the stability of hedgehog downstream transcription factor cubitus interruptus, the Drosophila homologue of vertebrate Gli molecules, is well documented, the mechanism by which PKA inhibits the functions of Gli molecules in vertebrates remains elusive. Here, we report that activation of PKA retains Gli1 in the cytoplasm. Conversely, inhibition of PKA activity promotes nuclear accumulation of Gli1. Mutation analysis identifies Thr374 as a major PKA site determining Gli1 protein localization. In the three-dimensional structure, Thr374 resides adjacent to the basic residue cluster of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Phosphorylation of this Thr residue is predicted to alter the local charge and consequently the NLS function. Indeed, mutation of this residue to Asp (Gli1/T374D) results in more cytoplasmic Gli1 whereas a mutation to Lys (Gli1/T374K) leads to more nuclear Gli1. Disruption of the NLS causes Gli1/T374K to be more cytoplasmic. We find that the change of Gli1 localization is correlated with the change of its transcriptional activity. These data provide evidence to support a model that PKA regulates Gli1 localization and its transcriptional activity, in part, through modulating the NLS function.", "venue": "Journal of Biological Chemistry", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 41, "citationCount": 127, "influentialCitationCount": 7, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://www.jbc.org/article/S0021925819477697/pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Medicine", "Chemistry", "Biology"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2006-01-06", "journal": {"volume": "281", "pages": "12 - 9", "name": "Journal of Biological Chemistry"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Sheng2006RegulationOG,\n author = {Tao Sheng and Sumin Chi and Xiao-li Zhang and Jingwu Xie},\n booktitle = {Journal of Biological Chemistry},\n journal = {Journal of Biological Chemistry},\n pages = {12 - 9},\n title = {Regulation of Gli1 Localization by the cAMP/Protein Kinase A Signaling Axis through a Site Near the Nuclear Localization Signal*},\n volume = {281},\n year = {2006}\n}\n"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "46384923", "name": "Tao Sheng"}, {"authorId": "47953465", "name": "Sumin Chi"}, {"authorId": "144007836", "name": "Xiao-li Zhang"}, {"authorId": "39703922", "name": "Jingwu Xie"}]}}, {"intents": [], "contexts": [], "citedPaper": {"paperId": "cf1631f486167031d3429ac3e81d2bb99f33f15e", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7089556", "MAG": "2101796829", "DOI": "10.1007/s11373-005-9035-9", "CorpusId": 1856831, "PubMed": "16228284"}, "corpusId": 1856831, "publicationVenue": {"id": "db0006bf-7589-4a3f-a886-73869a2eecde", "name": "Journal of Biomedical Sciences", "type": "journal", "alternate_names": ["Journal of Biomedical Science", "J Biomed Sci", "Journal of Biomedical Sciencies"], "issn": "2676-1343", "alternate_issns": ["1021-7770", "2382-5545", "2254-609X"], "url": "https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JBS/index", "alternate_urls": ["http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/tocrender.fcgi?action=archive&journal=857", "https://link.springer.com/journal/11373", "http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=JournalHome&ContentOnly=false&ProduktNr=224178", "http://www.jbiomedsci.com/"]}, "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf1631f486167031d3429ac3e81d2bb99f33f15e", "title": "Modular organization of SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein", "abstract": null, "venue": "Journal of Biomedical Sciences", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount": 264, "influentialCitationCount": 10, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11373-005-9035-9.pdf", "status": null}, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Chemistry", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2005-10-14", "journal": {"volume": "13", "pages": "59 - 72", "name": "Journal of Biomedical Science"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Chang2005ModularOO,\n author = {Chung-ke Chang and S.

Coronaviruses, like the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated virus (SARS-CoV), bud from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. In this study, the subcellular distribution and maturation of SARS-CoV surface proteins S, M and E were analysed by using C-terminally tagged proteins. As early as 30 min post-entry into the endoplasmic reticulum, high-mannosylated S assembles into trimers prior to acquisition of complex N-glycans in the Golgi. Like S, M acquires high-mannose N-glycans that are subsequently modified into complex N-glycans in the Golgi. The N-glycosylation profile and the absence of O-glycosylation on M protein relate SARS-CoV to the previously described group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that S is detected in several compartments along the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane while M predominantly localizes in the Golgi, where it accumulates, and in trafficking vesicles. The E protein is not glycosylated. Pulse-chase labelling and confocal microscopy in the presence of protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide revealed that the E protein has a short half-life of 30 min. E protein is found in bright perinuclear patches colocalizing with endoplasmic reticulum markers. In conclusion, SARS-CoV surface proteins S, M and E show differential subcellular localizations when expressed alone suggesting that additional cellular or viral factors might be required for coordinated trafficking to the virus assembly site in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment.", "venue": "Journal of General Virology", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 72, "citationCount": 246, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2005-05-01", "journal": {"volume": "86 Pt 5", "pages": "\n          1423-34\n        ", "name": "The Journal of general virology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Nal2005DifferentialMA,\n author = {B.

Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence, conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase.

In infected cells MHV produces a 3\u2032 coterminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. Only the genomic RNA, however, is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein and incorporated in infectious MHV virions. It is believed that an RNA packaging signal (Ps), present only in the genomic RNA, is responsible for this selectivity. Earlier studies mapped this signal to a 69-nt stem\u2013loop structure positioned in the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b. The selective encapsidation mechanism probably initiates by specific interaction of the packaging signal with the nucleocapsid protein. In this study we demonstrate thein vitrointeraction of the MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein with the packaging signal of MHV using gel retardation and UV cross-linking assays. This interaction was observed not only with the nucleocapsid protein from infected cells but also with that from purified virions and from cells expressing a recombinant nucleocapsid protein. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition experiments with nonlabeled Ps containing RNAs, tRNA, and total cytoplasmic RNA. The results indicated that no virus specific modification of the N-protein or the presence of other viral proteins are required for thisin vitrointeraction. The assays described in this report provide us with a powerful tool for studying encapsidation (initiation) in more detail.\n \n", "venue": "Virology", "year": 1997, "referenceCount": 65, "citationCount": 83, "influentialCitationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Biology", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Medicine", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "1997-12-08", "journal": {"volume": "239", "pages": "78 - 86", "name": "Virology"}, "citationStyles": {"bibtex": "@Article{Molenkamp1997IdentificationOA,\n author = {R.

Under certain conditions significant interactions occurred between components of Nonidet P-40-disrupted virions. Incubation of the Nonidet P-40-disrupted virus at 37 degrees C resulted in formation of a complex between one of the viral glycoproteins, E1, and the viral nucleocapsid. This was caused by a temperature-dependent conformational change in E1, resulting in aggregation of E1 and interaction with the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid. E1 also bound rRNA. The E1-nucleocapsid complexes can be distinguished on sucrose and Renografin density gradients from native viral nucleocapsids.
